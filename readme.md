# Pi-hole adlist

This is a list of adlists I use with my Pi-hole, all compiled into a single file. Updated daily.

It may not be perfect for everyone, but it's a good starting point.

The list currently contains around *~2.4* million domains.

## Usage

To use this list, simply add the following URL to your Pi-hole:
